However, deforestation reduces the number of trees and therefore decreasing rate of photosynthesis, increasing amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide present in the air.

Crops are grown for cash and are sold to meet both local and global needs</li><li>EV: Large areas of rainforest in Borneo and Sumatra are converted to palm oil plantations for many everyday products that contain palm oil like chocolate and toothpaste</li><li>L: Both subsistence and commercial farming activities have cleared a large area of the forest to grow more crops in order to meet the basic needs of man. As a result, more forest land is removed to make way for the establishment of plantations. Hence, the rate of deforestation has increased greatly</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="cattle-ranching"></a>Cattle ranching<a class="hash-link" href="#cattle-ranching" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>P: As the population increases, man’s basic needs for food increases. He turns to his physical environment such as the forest to cultivate crops and rear animals</li><li>EL: Cattle ranching involves operating large farms to raise cattle</li><li>EX: Large areas of TRF are cleared to create land for cattle to graze. Cattle need a large area for them to move about and grass or other crops to feed them. The demand for meat protein has increased in the market due to growing affluence.</li><li>EV: A large amount of beef from cattle in the Amazon is exported to other countries. The United States and Britain are the 2 largest importers of Brazillian beef</li><li>L: The demand for animal protein has increased due to growing affluence and more land is required.

It gives rise to a massive clearing of forest for timber.</li><li>EL: The cutting down of trees for timber. Commercial logging of tropical hardwoods to make (teak, mahogany, rosewood) furniture, building materials and charcoal.</li><li>EX: Growing demand for timber products increases logging activity. Logging reduces the no. of trees and damages the TRF as a whole. For every one tree extracted, five trees are badly damaged. Commercial logging is responsible for destroying 50,000km2 of TRF every year.</li><li>EV: Japan is one of the world’s biggest consumers of timber as a lot of wood is used for their building and furniture of which, much of this supply comes from Borneo</li><li>L: Logging provides raw materials for the industries involved in construction to fuel where it supports the growth of industries, the building of shelters, factories, to meet man’s needs. Hence, the demand for the use of timber increases, and logging takes place at a large and fast scale, causing rapid deforestation</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="mining"></a>Mining<a class="hash-link" href="#mining" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>P: The forest provides metals, minerals and precious stones.

These materials are needed to produce electronic products such as phones</li><li>L: Mines are established to extract metals to build more electronic devices such as phones to meet the increasing demand for electronic devices due to technology advancement, leading to deforestation.</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="impacts"></a>Impacts<a class="hash-link" href="#impacts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Lx: Points

And this prevents total clearance of a forest. In recent years, Brazil’s environmental enforcement agency has stopped several illegal loggers. However, controlled logging has its challenges.</li><li>C:  Identifying and logging selected trees is time-consuming and difficult to implement as there are many different species of plants present to be identified. / Areas designated for controlled logging in the Amazon still face threats from illegal loggers as the rainforest covers a large area, making it difficult to track illegal loggers.</li><li>L: By using controlled logging as a measure to combat deforestation, to a large extent, the programme has made some progress in reducing the loss of forest areas</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="reforestation"></a>Reforestation<a class="hash-link" href="#reforestation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>P: Reforestation is a plausible measure to reduce deforestation.</li><li>EL: Planting of trees in areas where the original forest has been cleared.</li><li>EX: This involves non-profit organisations, companies and local communities. It takes a long time - 15 years for a rainforest canopy to form.</li><li>EV: An example is the LATA (Latin America Travel Association) Foundation. A large amount of the money goes back to the local communities through the purchase of seedlings and planting of trees, 70,000 trees were planted in 2011.</li><li>B: Reforestation allows soil fertility to be improved which in the long term helps sustain plant growth in the area.
